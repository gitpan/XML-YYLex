XML/YYLex version 0.03
======================

$Id: README,v 1.2 2003/01/11 00:50:17 daniel Exp $

XML::YYLex is a helper module that helps you build XML-parsing
applications with the help of byacc (Berkeley Yacc). A DOM-parser is
used as what is traditionally called a scanner (or tokenizer). Currently
XML::DOM and XML::Sablotron::DOM are supported, but others might be added.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

In order to be useful, you probably need one of the following DOM-parsers:

	- XML::DOM (tested with version 1.41)
	- XML::Sablotron::DOM (tested with 0.96 and 0.90)

You further need a version of perl-byacc, which is a version of Berkeley
Yacc that can produce perl-code. I couldn't find the original site, but
you can find it on Debian.

I developed and tested the module with perl 5.8.0 and made it work with
perl 5.6.1 now. Older versions might work if the prerequisites above are
fulfilled. I don't know if the test framework generated by h2xs still
works with older versions of perl. Let me know about your problems or
if you get it running on older versions.
